# Data-Persistence-Project
For Unity Programming class
Top 5 scores, names associated with the scores and current name of the player is stored in a persistent GameObject to persist between scenes.
High scores are also saved in a Json file to persist between sessions.
Couldn't find a way to automatize the highscore too much and I think there might be a better solution to store the scores the way I wanted.
